# Snake
Bevvy snake tutorial by marcusbuffett and extended by me.

## My additions
- Food doesn't spawn on the snake anymore
- Food is not on a timer anymore. New food spawns after the current is being eaten.
- Implemented an input buffer that saves two inputs and made it impossible to turn 180Â° in place (which would result in a game over).
